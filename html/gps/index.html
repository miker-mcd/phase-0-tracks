          <h3>Release 4: Reflect</h3>
          <ul>
          <li>The purpose of HTML5 semantic tags is to provide more detailed structure to a website for the browser and user. Semantic tags provide a descriptive meaning to the content that it contains, which addresses accessibility issues that the previous version of HTML did not. I think the most useful are main, section, article nav and aside.</li>
          <li>A browser typically displays elements in a top to bottom order, but I've read that information can be displayed randomly as well.</li>
          <li>I learned that Sublime is a useful text editor for creating preformatted pieces of code that can make it faster and more convenient to write code. I think I would create more snippets, especially to include style sheet references and later scripts.</li>
          <li>I think knowing the purpose of the different semantic tags is the most difficult for me. I can see why using divs with different names to label areas of a website is easier for the person writing the code, but is harder for the viewer of the website to understand. The HTML5 flowchart was helpful for differentiating the use of the semantic tags.</li>
