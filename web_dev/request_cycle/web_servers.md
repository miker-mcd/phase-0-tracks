What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
  - Portability: software can perform the same way across any device or hardware.
  - Open Source: Source code is freely available and is a community based project that is continuously updated.
  - Multi-User: Multiple users can access system resources at the same time.
  - Multiprogramming: Multiple applications can run at the same time.
  - Hierarchical File System: Standard file structure is used.
  - Shell: Provides a command line interpreter program similar to bash in Apple. Allows the user to access the operating system through the command line.
  - Security: Provides security using authentication features.

In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
  - A VPS is basically a miniature version of a computer without the hardware, but has an operating system and can support the software that the operating system allows for. The VPS is created and maintained through a VPS hosting service which provides a small chunk of it's server space depending on what the customer pays to host their VPS. The customer VPS can be used as a server for a website.
  - Some advantages of using a VPS are that a user has more control over the server environment compared to shared hosting, is customizable, scalable to a user's needs, is typically less expensive than a dedicated server setup and allows a user to experiment with the server without risk of damaging or irreversible issues. Some disadvantages are that a user needs to have some knowledge about how to set up and maintain a VPS, service may be affected by the overall performance of the VPS hosting service, and it is typically more expensive than a shared hosting service.

Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
  - Security is the main reason why it's bad to run programs as the root user on a Linux system. Using root opens the operating system to potential risks that could affect the entire system including viruses, bugs or mistakes that are made like deleting a program or file. When you are using Linux under a user profile, security is maintained or at least the risk is minimized to the user profile and not the entire operating system.
