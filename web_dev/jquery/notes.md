After downloading jQuery I ended up navigating through the jQuery Learning Center from the jQuery website and found it to be pretty useful. I first went through the About jQuery page and copied the sample code to the script.js file to see the examples in action. Then I read through the Events and Effects pages in the same way. I did take a short 2 minute break after 30 minutes of research.
