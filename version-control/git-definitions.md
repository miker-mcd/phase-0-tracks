# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is the process of distributing an original project into separate versions and creating features or changes that build upon that original project without the original file being affected all at once. The distributed copies of the original can merge into the original project or can become their own projects. It's useful because it allows the user(s) to save multiple versions of a project to work on without affecting the original project.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a reference point to a version of a project. The branch can be used to add a specific feature of the project and can be merged back into another branch or the original project.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit occurs after a file has been updated or modified and is ready to be saved. A commit is a save point for the project and helps to track what changes or updates were made to a specific feature. This allows the user(s) to easily follow the changes or to track where an issue might have occurred in the project. A good commit message is concise, but specific about the change or changes that were made. To create a good commit message, a user should ask himself whether a user who is new to the project would understand the message and move on.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is an indicator that there is a difference in the code between a branch and another branch or the master branch when attempting to merge branches. Changes may have been made to a branch that were not merged previously with a feature branch so there is a conflict that needs to be updated to the merging branch before it can be saved. Merge conflicts help the user to ensure they are working on the latest version of a master or feature branch.
